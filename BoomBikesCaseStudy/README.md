## General Information
- This is a casestudy on Linear Regression to predict the effect of multiple factors on Bike Rentals.
- Main Business problems:
    - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
    - How well those variables describe the bike demands


## Conclusions
  - Bike Demands increase by 0.41 times the Temperature (Positive)
  - Bike Demands decrease by 0.25 times during Lightsnow (Negative)
  - Bike Demands decrease by 0.15 times during Spring (Negative)
