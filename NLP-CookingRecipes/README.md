# Business Objective

The data set comprises culinary recipes with a focus on ingredient extraction and analysis. Each recipe features a structured ingredient list with labelled components, identifying ingredients, quantities and units. This diverse collection supports tasks such as understanding recipes and discovering culinary knowledge, enabling the development of models for information extraction in the culinary domain.

The business objective is to leverage the increasing popularity of online cooking platforms and meal-planning apps by enhancing the user experience. This can be achieved by implementing a custom-named entity recognition (NER) model to automatically tag ingredients, quantities and recipe names. This automation will streamline the process of organising recipes, improve searchability and enable users to easily find recipes based on available ingredients, portion sizes or specific dietary requirements. This will ultimately reduce the labour-intensive and inefficient manual tagging process, providing a more accessible and efficient way for businesses in the food and recipe industry to manage their recipe databases.
